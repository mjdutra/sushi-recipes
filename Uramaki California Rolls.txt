Ingredients:
2 cups Japanese short or medium grain rice
2 to 2 1/2 cups cold water
5 Tbsp Sushi Vinegar
1/2 lb Imitation crab meat
1 Avocado, ripe but still firm
1/2 medium cucumber, peeled and sliced into long julienne strips
Toasted Nori Seaweed
Toasted sesame seeds

Instructions:
1. Wrap your in plastic wrap before using it (this makes it re-useable and you don’t even have to wash it!).
2. Fold the pieces of nori in half to split them.
3. Toast your sesame seeds over medium heat, stirring constantly until golden. Slice up your veggies and crab meat.
4. Spread a generous handful of sushi rice onto the 1/2 sheet of nori. Use your WET FINGER TIPS (keep your hands wet to prevent sticking) to spread the rice evenly over the entire surface of the nori.
5. Flip the rice covered piece of nori over so the rice is facing down (this way, your rice will be on the outside). Place your fillings across the center of your nori lengthwise (don’t overfill or the roll won’t seal).
6. Start rolling using your matt to firmly keep the roll in place. Apply some pressure to make a tight roll. If its not tight enough, it will be difficult to cut. Once the roll is complete, sprinkle the roll with toasted sesame seeds while it is still on the mat so you can turn it easily.
7. Run your sharp knife through a damp paper towel before slicing so the rice won’t stick as much. Cut the roll in half, then line the two halves up and slice into even 1-inch rings. I have found that it slices easier when you slice quickly.
