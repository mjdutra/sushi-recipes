Ingredients:
1 lb sashimi (any fish)
1 lb tamagoyaki
1 large avocado
1 cucumber
1/2 lb kanikama (imitation crab legs)
1/2 lb takuan
1 cup shredded carrots
10 sheets large roasted nori


Instructions:
 
1. Slice all sushi fillings (e.g. fish, cucumber, tamagoyaki, avocado) to 1/4" to 1/2" thick sticks. You can place the fillings on a serving platter, if desired.
2. Take your sheets of roasted seaweed and cut or tear lengthwise in half. Serve alongside sushi fillings and rice to allow your guests to make their own hand rolls.
3. To make a hand roll, place a small layer of sushi rice onto one half of your seaweed strip.
